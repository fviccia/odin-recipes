    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna, a classic Italian dish, is a hearty and comforting meal that
      combines layers of tender pasta, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and
      gooey melted cheese. The foundation of this beloved casserole begins with
      wide, flat lasagna noodles that are cooked to al dente perfection. Each
      layer is then generously spread with a robust Bolognese sauce, made from
      ground beef or sausage simmered with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and
      fragrant Italian herbs. The dish is elevated further by the inclusion of a
      velvety béchamel sauce or ricotta cheese mixture, which adds a luscious
      creaminess and depth of flavor. A generous topping of mozzarella and
      Parmesan cheese ensures a golden, bubbly crust that is irresistibly
      cheesy.

      The beauty of lasagna lies not only in its delectable taste but also in
      its versatility. While the traditional recipe calls for meat, it can
      easily be adapted to suit various dietary preferences. Vegetarians can
      replace the meat sauce with a medley of roasted vegetables or a savory
      spinach and mushroom filling, while those seeking a lighter option might
      opt for whole wheat noodles and a low-fat cheese blend. Lasagna can be
      prepared ahead of time, making it an ideal dish for entertaining or busy
      weeknights. Simply assemble the layers, refrigerate, and bake when ready
      to serve. Whether you're indulging in a classic meat version or
      experimenting with new ingredients, lasagna promises a comforting and
      satisfying meal that brings family and friends together around the table.
