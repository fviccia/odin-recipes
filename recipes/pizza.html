    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza, a beloved Italian classic, is a versatile dish that delights with
      its combination of a crispy yet chewy crust, tangy tomato sauce, and an
      array of toppings all crowned with melted cheese. Originating from Naples,
      this dish has evolved into countless variations, from the traditional
      Margherita with fresh basil and mozzarella to more inventive versions
      featuring diverse ingredients like pepperoni, mushrooms, and arugula. The
      base, often made from a simple dough of flour, water, yeast, and salt,
      serves as a blank canvas, allowing cooks to personalize their pizzas to
      suit any palate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appeal of pizza lies not only in its rich flavors but also in its ease
      of preparation and endless customization options. Whether baked in a
      wood-fired oven for an authentic touch or in a conventional oven at home,
      pizza is a communal meal that brings people together. From choosing
      favorite toppings to experimenting with different cheeses and sauces,
      making pizza can be a fun and creative experience. Whether you prefer a
      classic Margherita, a meaty pepperoni, or a vegetarian delight, pizza
      offers a universally loved meal that's perfect for any occasion.

      <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

      <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 475°F (245°C) and place a pizza stone or baking sheet
        inside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water; let it sit for 5
        minutes until foamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add flour, salt, and olive oil to the yeast mixture; knead until a
        smooth dough forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the dough and let it rise for about 1 hour or until doubled in
        size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch down the dough and roll it out on a floured surface to your
        desired thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the dough to a piece of parchment paper for easy handling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for
        the crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce and add your choice
        of toppings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated stone or baking sheet
        using the parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is
        bubbly. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.
